This directory contains babylon.js demo code with experimental changes.

It doesn't necessarily work and has no value. I suggest you visit the
babylon.js site and get working demos. Other than that you can do whatever
you want with these modified demos. Just don't blame me for anything; I
told you the code here didn't work.
